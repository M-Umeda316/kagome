## 2026-06-11: Time variable t in f1(t) resets each biased segment
- Context: Eq. 5 defines f1(t) = min(γt, f1_max). The paper does not explicitly state whether t resets at the start of each biased segment or accumulates across the entire simulation.
- Paper anchor: Eq. 5, Section 2.1 ("monotonically from 0"), biased/unbiased alternation schedule (Fig. 1).
- Decision: t is measured from the start of each biased segment and resets to 0 when a new biased segment begins. Units of t are MD time steps within that segment.
- Alternatives considered: (a) Cumulative t across entire simulation — rejected because the biased/unbiased alternation implies periodic relaxation and restart. (b) Reset on reaction event — more complex, no explicit paper support.
- Scientific risk: Low. If the paper intends cumulative t, the boost will saturate at f1_max quickly and the practical difference is minimal for long simulations.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: Verify against paper supplementary materials if available.

## 2026-06-11: Units convention for gamma
- Context: Eq. 5 defines f1(t) = γt. With f1 in kcal/mol and t in steps, gamma has units kcal/(mol·step).
- Paper anchor: Eq. 5, Table of hyperparameters (γ = 1.0).
- Decision: gamma is in kcal/(mol·step). With gamma=1.0 and f1_max=250 kcal/mol, the ramp saturates at step 250 of a 2000-step biased segment.
- Alternatives considered: gamma in kcal/(mol·fs), which would saturate at 250 fs = 1000 steps. The difference is quantitative, not qualitative.
- Scientific risk: Medium. Affects the effective boost ramp rate. Configurable, so can be adjusted.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: Check if paper specifies gamma units explicitly.

## 2026-06-11: numpy as sole core dependency
- Context: The TDBB equations and selection logic are purely numerical.
- Paper anchor: N/A (implementation choice).
- Decision: Use numpy as the only runtime dependency for the core package. ASE, OpenMM, etc. are optional backend dependencies.
- Alternatives considered: Pure Python (too slow for distance matrices), scipy (overkill for initial implementation).
- Scientific risk: None.
- Licensing/commercial impact: numpy is BSD-3, fully commercial-safe.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-06-12: JSONL as trajectory output format
- Context: Phase 2 requires trajectory output for figure regeneration. Multiple formats considered.
- Paper anchor: Figs. 2-6 require time-series data of energy, conversion, and spatial density.
- Decision: Use JSON Lines (.jsonl) with a metadata header line. Each subsequent line is one frame.
- Alternatives considered: (a) ASE Trajectory — requires ASE dependency (LGPL, license discussion needed). (b) HDF5 — requires h5py, overkill for current scale. (c) XYZ — lacks structured metadata.
- Scientific risk: None. Format is lossless and machine-parseable.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None (json is stdlib).
- Follow-up: Consider binary format (HDF5) for production-scale runs.

## 2026-06-12: matplotlib as optional plot dependency
- Context: Figure regeneration requires a plotting library.
- Paper anchor: Figs. 2-6 reproduction.
- Decision: Add matplotlib as optional dependency under `[project.optional-dependencies] plot`. Not a core dependency.
- Alternatives considered: plotly (heavier), raw SVG (impractical for scatter/line plots).
- Scientific risk: None.
- Licensing/commercial impact: matplotlib is PSF-licensed (permissive), commercial-safe.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-06-12: Atomic masses optional with backward-compatible default
- Context: Phase 1 used unit masses (m=1 for all atoms). Real MD requires proper atomic masses.
- Paper anchor: Standard MD methodology; paper uses OpenMM which handles masses automatically.
- Decision: Add `masses: NDArray | None = None` to SimulationState. When None, unit masses are used (backward-compatible). When provided, forces are divided by mass before integration.
- Alternatives considered: Making masses mandatory — rejected to preserve existing tests and toy use case.
- Scientific risk: Low. Users who provide species can easily derive masses.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: Consider making masses mandatory in a future major version.

## 2026-06-12: Integrator as swappable protocol
- Context: Paper implies NVT ensemble (constant temperature) which requires a thermostat. Phase 1 used bare velocity Verlet (NVE).
- Paper anchor: Section 2 describes NVT simulations at 300-600K.
- Decision: Extract integrator into a Protocol with implementations for VelocityVerlet and Langevin. PolymerizationWorkflow accepts an optional integrator parameter, defaulting to VelocityVerlet.
- Alternatives considered: Hard-coding Langevin as the only option — rejected because Verlet is useful for testing and debugging.
- Scientific risk: Low. Default remains Verlet for backward compatibility; users opt in to Langevin.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-06-12: Event-based bond tracking over distance-threshold inference
- Context: Need to track which bonds form/break for conversion analysis (Eq. 11-12).
- Paper anchor: Eq. 11-12 require counting formed/broken bonds.
- Decision: Track bonds as explicit attempt/confirm events. TDBB already selects specific pairs, so we record attempts at biased-phase start and confirm outcomes after unbiased relaxation using threshold_fraction × r0.
- Alternatives considered: Post-hoc distance analysis at every frame — rejected as ambiguous (what cutoff?) and expensive.
- Scientific risk: Low. Threshold fraction (default 1.2) is configurable.
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: Tune threshold_fraction against real MLIP results.

## 2026-06-12: Reactive group atom removal after confirmed formation
- Context: Once atoms form a bond, they should not be selected as candidates again.
- Paper anchor: Implicit in polymerization chemistry — reacted sites are consumed.
- Decision: After each unbiased phase, remove confirmed-formation atoms from their reactive groups.
- Alternatives considered: (a) Keep all atoms — leads to re-boosting already-bonded atoms. (b) Reclassify into new groups — more complex, deferred.
- Scientific risk: Low for formation. Dissociation events are not handled (atoms are not re-added).
- Licensing/commercial impact: None.
- Follow-up: Add re-addition logic for dissociation if needed for curing simulations.
